# Lesson-UI-Prototype

This branch contains the UI Prototype for Lessons. Just like on the Original Smith-Pad. 

FOIL-Home will have a new feature that will include Lessons that will teach people, particularly people with disabilities, how to learn some independent living skills using a similar learning design to Smith-Pad.
