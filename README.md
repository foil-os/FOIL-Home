# Lesson-UI-Prototype

This branch contains the UI Prototype for Lessons. Just like on the Original Smith-Pad. 

FOIL-Home will have a new feature where it will contain Lessons that will help people, especially people with disabilities to learn how to learn some independent living skills, with the similar learning design like Smith-Pad.
